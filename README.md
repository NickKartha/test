Test Respository to Learn the Basics of Git and Github. Everyone is welcome to make changes and make this into a useful projects for others. Go on. Create branches! 

I'm currently using this repo to learn Cmake: https://tuannguyen68.gitbooks.io/learning-cmake-a-beginner-s-guide/content/chap1/chap1.html

Here, instead of ucing gcc, we are using cmake.

## Notes

``` cmake --build myprogram -- <GNU_MAKE_ARGUMENTS_GO_HERE> ```
``` mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make -j ```
```cd myprogram && mkdir ../myprogram_build && cd ../myprogram_build && cmake ../myprogram && cmake --build```

also, it's not best to install cmake from apt-get.
reportedly, it's really not very difficult at all to just install the latest cmake binaries in your home directory.

Thanks for visiting this repository.
Have a pleasant day!
